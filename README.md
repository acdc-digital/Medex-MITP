# Medex-Public-MITP
Welcome to the Medex public repo, the Public version's for Open-Source Medex updates, changes, and contributions. Application specific readme notes can be found within the main directory. 

July 7, 2023:
Today was the first day of opening the Public repo. I'll continue to update the files as I upload them and reformat the files to create a more unified experience for contributors, or Users who simply want to play with the program in their termainal. 

As of today, we're still using the OpenAI library for most of our interactions with a language model. The Medex application will continue to be developed moving towards its ultimate goal of a unified multi-expert experience, where they will benefit from the translation of complex medical diagnosis into laymans terms. Users will also be able to share snippets of their medical charts, this allows family and support networks to chat-against the Users' snippets or comments. 

Medex is literally built on the founding principles:

"Medex is an evolutionary chat application, where users upload their medical information into the app, and then they can conversationally chat against their own data to understand it better. Then they can choose which information they want to share with others, which will allow others to chat against their data or comments. All without communication between either group. This helps the people, and supporting community to create a universal understanding of complex diagnosis in a way their support network will actually know how to help."

I appreciate your patience as we continue to work the changes into consistent practice and have a working application within the terminal in the next few days! Stay tuned.
