The OpenAI-Cookbook [https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook] has been an incredible resource. Recently, I've discovered, "Question/ answering using an API and HyDe." Which I believe will be a sucessful priliminary implementation  of how we're going to transform our User query's.

The concept is simple enough: Step 1: Search; User asks a question and GPT generates a list of potential queries. Search queries are executed in parallel. Step 2: Re-rank; Embeddings for each result are used to calculate semantic similarity to a generated hypothetical ideal answer to the user question. Results are ranked and filtered based on this similarity metric.
Step 3: Answer; Given the top search results, the model generates an answer to the userâ€™s question, including references and links.
This hybrid approach offers relatively low latency and can be integrated into any existing search endpoint, without requiring the upkeep of a vector database.

Welcome to the Medex public repo, the Public-Version for Open-Source Medex updates, changes, and contributions. Application specific readme notes can be found within the main directory. Application overview (not complete- the below is a placeholder for now until the finished diagram is done):

<h3>Get started</h3> 

```
git clone https://github.com/acdc-digital/Medex-Public-MITP  
```
by going to: ```cd /Users/filepath/Medex-Public-MITP/Medex```  and simply copy and paste into your notebook as needed. The Jupyter Playground will eventually become a Colab notebook, but for now, set up a new environment and following along with the code-blocks. We'll keep the blocks in the playground as the latest stable version, as other documents may continue to get tinkered with throughout development.
